# inside command prompt/powershell (with admin privileges)
bcdedit /enum firmware

# note down path to Manjaro grub. 
This one -> \EFI\Manjaro\grubx64.efi

# set Manjaro grub as default boot loader
bcdedit /set "{bootmgr}" path "\EFI\Manjaro\grubx64.efi"

# to set it back to windows, if needed
bcdedit /set "{bootmgr}" path "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi"


------
Notes to self:

- This applies if Manjaro grub & Windows bootmgr are on the same partition
- What happens when they are on separate disks and "bcdedit /enum firmware" can't see the other disk??
